*The five wise men of the Kingdom of ... , back from a long stay in the Republic of ... , were quiet and fearful of their sovereign Queen : they were reporting to the Queen about the Weird Thing that there exists in that republic.*

* *Tell us, oh wise Protos, what looks like the Weird Thing?, asked the Queen to the wise elder man.*

* *The Weird Thing they call science, oh Your Majesty, can record and compress all the facts. In fact, science is a huge registry. Thus spoke Protos.*

* *Off with her head!, cried the queen, red with anger.How can we believe that the Weird Thing is a thinking machine , when even we have ideas?*

*After which addressed Deuteros, the oldest of the wise man remaining:*

* *Tell us, oh wise Deuteros, what looks like the Weird Thing?*

* *The Weird Thing, Your Majesty, is not a passive recorder, but a busy information mill: it absorbs tons of raw data and prepares and presents in order. My decision is that science is a huge calculator. Thus spoke Deuteros.*

* *Off with her head !, cried the Queen, green with anger. How can we believe that the Weird Thing is an automaton, if even we have quirks and foibles?*

*After that she spoke to Tritos, the middle-aged man:*

* *Tell us, oh wise Tritos, what looks like the Weird Thing?*

* *There is such a rare thing , Your Majesty. Science is an esoteric game. Those who play it set its rules, and change them from time to time in a mysterious way. Nobody knows what they play or for what purpose. Let us assume, then, that science, like language, is a game. Thus spoke Tritos.*

* *Off with her head !, shouted the Queen, yellow with anger. How can we believe that the Weird Thing does not take things seriously when we are able to do it?*

*After which he addressed to Tertatos, wise mature man:*

* *Tell us, oh wise Tertaros, what looks like the Weird Thing?*

* *The Weird Thing, oh Your Majesty, is a man who meditates and fast. He has visions, tries to prove they are wrong and is proud when he doesn't get it. I think that science, I challenge all to refute me, is a flagellant visionary. Thus spoke Tertaros.*

* *Off with her head !, shouted the Queen, red with anger. This report is more subtle than others, but how can we believe that the Weird Thing doesn't worry about justification or reward, when even we can do?*

*After which he spoke to Pentos, the young wise man. But Pentos, fearing for his life, had already fled. He ran nonstop for days and nights, until he crossed the border of the Kingdom of ...*

**Remark:** *The four wise man of the Kingdom of ... are still alive. Protos and Deuteros survived because the executioner did not find them a head to cut. Tritos, because after execution he got that a new skull will grow by convention. Tetartos, because he invented a new brain as soon as he had been refuted that he had.*
