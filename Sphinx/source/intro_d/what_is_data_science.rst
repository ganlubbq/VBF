What is Data Science?
*********************

Currently, there is no consensus among experts on the definition of the concept of Data Science. There are different conceptions of Data Science, just as there are different interpretations of Science. Mario Bunge's story serves as an introduction to this section and summarizes briefly the interpretations given to Science. These interpretations are directly applicable to Data Science. What is this "Weird Thing" that the chameleonic Queen want to know (chameleonic when she gets angry)?

Many experts see no distinction between Data Science and **Statistics**. As Protos, they emphasizes the importance of Math and Statistics Knowledge for collecting and analysis numerical data.

Other experts highlight the benefits of a scientific discipline called **Machine Learning** that provides algorithms to learn from data. This would be the calculator interpretation that Deuteros spoke about in the story.

Some experts focus on the **hacking skills** needed to being able to manipulate text files at the command-line, understanding vectorized operations, thinking algorithmically. They somehow share the view with Tritos as an esoteric game.

There are data-savvy professional that gives special importance to the Substantive Expertise needed to execute successful data science projects. Those professionals would agree with Tertaros on seeing data scientists as flagellant visionaries. 

Apart from these four mentioned wise men, Mario Bunge's story implies that the young Pentos had its own answer, but chose to flee. Let's imagine that Pentos stays, giving his answer. Let's image I am Pentos and I am going to give my definition without the fear of having my head cut. 

I would say that **Data Science is the extraction of knowledge from data associated with a system in order to predict its behaviour by means of models**. As an interdisciplinary subject, data science draws scientific inquiry from a broad range of academic subject areas, such as:

* Math and Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Computer Science

This is illustrated by Drew Conway is his famous Data Science Veen Diagram:

In the following subsections, concepts associated with my Data Science definition are analysed: Knowledge, Models, Prediction.
