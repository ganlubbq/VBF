Prediction
==========

Projection
----------

Forecasts are answers to questions such as: What would be the value of *y* given *x*? When will happen $y$ if $x$ is satisfied? Their answers are commonly called predictions. A scientific prediction (or retrodiction) is a forecast (hindsight) **based on theories and scientifically verified data**. It is:

* **Conditional**: it indicates what will happen (or what can happen), or when will it happen (or when can it happen) if some laws are met and if some conditions or circumstances are satisfied. As a result, a failure in a scientific prediction does not discredit science but maybe the scientists.

* **Theoretical**: it uses laws which do not necessarily need to contain temporal variables.

* It refers to set of **properties**, of things and events.

* It can be as **accurate** as our knowledge of laws and circumstances. A characteristic of scientific prediction is the possibility to improve its accuracy.

The logic structure of scientific prediction is identical to deductive explanation: deductive inference from laws and data (*L* means laws and *C* means circumstances). The argumentation premises can be called premises of **proyectans** and the conclusions **proyectandum**.

Stochastic projection
---------------------

The less accurate projection is **enumeration of possibilities**. 

The prediction based on baselines of trending or development. The purpose is to predict the most probable value of a variable *y*, from the corresponding value of a correlated variable *x*, and several statistics parameters, such as means and standard deviations. In this case, a quantitative estimation can be done, specially if there is a strong correlation between *x* and *y*. If the given data tend to group around a line. No matter how accurate the calculation is, it is of a probable value, that is, of a value
