Understanding
=============

In Aristotle's *Physics* (s. IV B.C.), the predominant model was the teleological explanation. For instance, the Aristotelian explanation of gravity is that all bodies move toward their natural place. With Galileo Galilei (s. XVI-XVII), the deductive explanation is imposed, replacing the Aristotelian explanation. Because of this, many experts believe all sciences must follow the deductive explanation as the unique model. However, in XIX century new disciplines (for instance history and psychology) are recognized as sciences and achieved a great development. Then, the german philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911) asserted that these new sciences, called human sciences, cannot use explanations.

Dilthey proposed to distinguish between natural sciences, whose purpose is **to explain**, and human sciences, whose purpose is **to understand**. there is no consensus among researchers regarding the meaning of **understanding**. The human facts are understood if we put ourselves on their shoes, capture their singularity, apprehend their meaning, integrate in their context, etc.

The difference between to explain and to understand is brightly illustrated in Edgar Allan Poe's *The Purloined Letter* (1845). The Minister D- hid in his home a letter which contains compromising information that he stole. The Prefect of the Parisian police, monsieur G-, searched Minister D-'s home thoroughly without success. They did not use an adequate method: the police searched focusing only on the methods they would have followed to hide it. Poe narrated that they are mistaken because:

	*what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of search, which are based upon the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the long routine of his duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter*

	The main character, detective C. Auguste Dupin, strives to understand the way of thinking of Minister D: to put himself on his shoes, to think as he would have thought, that is:

	*It is merely, I said, an identification of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent.*

	thus concluded that:

	*the more satisfied I became that, to conceal this letter, the Minister had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all.*

	The letter was in plain sight. 

It is not possible to distinguish between natural sciences (looking for explanations) and human sciences (looking for understandings). It is not posssible to separate explanation and understanding: explanations allows us to understand and to understand we ask for new explanations. As a consequence, some experts employ the expression: understandable explanation.
