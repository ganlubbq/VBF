Explanation
===========

To **explain** a system is to reduce its events to its causes. Sometimes, the concept of cause is frequently replaced by other concepts as: laws, functions, conditions, etc. In general, we can identify four kinds of explanations:

Deductive explanation
---------------------

An event that we want to explain (*explanandum*) is derived by a general law (explanans). Sometimes, it is necessary to resort to several laws (L\ :sub:`1`\, L\ :sub:`2`\, ..., L\ :sub:`n`\) and to other statements that asserts specific facts (F\ :sub:`1`\, F\ :sub:`2`\, ..., F\ :sub:`m`\). 


Probabilistic o stadistical explanation
---------------------------------------

It has the same structure as the previous one, but with one important exception: the laws that are used for explanation are only probabilistic not universal. Jason Christopher Robinson's definition is as follows:

	*Probabilistic explanation is a form a reasoning that considers either the likeliness of an event happening or the strength of one's belief about an event or statement; that is, probability may be about things or it may be about our degree of belief about things. It has an important role for case study researchers trying to understand highly complex, uncertain, and multiple or single events. Probability has become an increasingly important way of thinking about knowledge that is often uncertain and incomplete. Probabilistic explanation attributes to probability a helpful role by ascribing either a numerical value or a degree of credence to the likelihood of random events. It produces helpful causal descriptions of indeterminate phenomena by examining the relationship between cause and chance.*

Functional o teleological (finalistic) explanation
--------------------------------------------------
The two previous explanations answer the question "Why?" (which asks for the cause). This explanation answers the question "What for?" (which asks for the purpose -*telos* in ancient greek). This type of explanation is widely used in biology because in a organism every part or organ is to maintain the balance and survival of the whole. Dr. Francisco Ayala asserts the following:

	*An object or a behavior is said to be teleological when it gives evidence of design or appears to be directed toward certain ends. For example, the behavior of human beings is often teleological. A person who buys an airplane ticket, reads a book, or cultivates the earth is trying to achieve a certain end: getting to a given city, acquiring knowledge, or getting food. Objects and machines made by people also are usually teleological: a knife is made for cutting, a clock is made for telling time, a thermostat is made to regulate temperature. Similarly features of organisms are teleological as well: a bird's wings are for flying, eyes are for seeing, kidneys are constituted for regulating the composition of the blood. The features of organisms that may be said to be teleological are those that can be identified as adaptations, whether they are structures like a wing or a hand, or organs like a kidney, or behaviors like the courtship displays of a peacock. Adaptations are features of organisms that have come about by natural selection because they serve certain functions and thus increase the reproductive success of their carriers.*

However, this kind of explanation is controversial and many experts reduce it to a causal explanation: a bird's wings are not for flying, but they fly because they have wings.

Genetic explanation
-------------------

It explains a phenomenon or event from the facts that it is derived, that is, showing its genesis. This type of explanation is frequently used in historical sciences. For example, it can be used to analyze the historical situation of a language from the various events that has surpassed.

	*A language family is a group of languages related through descent from a common ancestor, called the proto-language of that family. The term 'family' reflects the tree model of language origination in historical linguistics, which makes use of a metaphor comparing languages to people in a biological family tree, or in a subsequent modification, to species in a phylogenetic tree of evolutionary taxonomy.*
