**Section 1: Introduction**
===========================

The introduction provides a brief description of the functions available in the VBF library and gives a general overview of the VBF's programming interface and conventions. It also illustrates how to obtain and install the library, and introduces some mathematical preliminaries and notations.  

**Section 2: Using the library**
================================

This chapter describes how to compile programs that use VBF and how to evaluate new algorithms.

**Section 3: Initializations and representations**
==================================================

In this chapter we are going to describe the methods that can be used to represent a VBF class related to a Vector Boolean Function. Some of these representations can be used to initialize a VBF class. 

**Section 4: Cryptographic Criteria**
=====================================

This chapter defines some properties relevant for cryptographic applications and explains how to use the package to compute them. Those properties are criteria or those which provide useful information in cryptanalysis.

**Section 5: Operations and constructions over Vector Boolean Functions**
=========================================================================

In this chapter, the operations over Vector Boolean Functions supported by the VBF library are described.

**Section 6: Analysis of AES competition cryptographic algorithms**
===================================================================

In January 1997, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced the start of an initiative to develop a new encryption standard: the AES. The AES selection process was open in which 15 candidates were accepted for the first evaluation round and 5 finalists were announced in the second round. On October 2, 2000, NIST officially announced that Rijndael would become the AES. In this chapter, a number of cryptographic algorithms from the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) candidates accepted for the first evaluation round process are analysed.

**Section 7: Analysis of DES-related cryptographic algorithms**
===============================================================

The Data Encryption Standard (DES), known as the Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA) by ANSI and the DEA-1 by the ISO, has been a worldwide standard for 20 years. Some other block ciphers were designed inspired on DES during this period of time. In this chapter, certain cryptographic algorithms from DES (Data Encryption Standard) and other block ciphers with a similar design philosophy are analysed.

**Section 8: Analysis of NESSIE project cryptographic algorithms**
==================================================================

The NESSIE call includes a request for a broad set of algorithms providing date confidentiality, data authentication, and entity authentication. These algorithms include block ciphers, stream ciphers, hash functions, MAC algorithms, digital signature schemes, and public-key encryption and identification schemes. In this chapter, several cryptographic algorithms from NESSIE (New European Schemes for Signature, Integrity, and Encryption) research project candidates are analysed.

**Section 9: Analysis of Rijndael-related cryptographic algorithms**
====================================================================

Rijndael block cipher is the result of a long design process with continuous improvements along the way. We are going to study some of its predecessors as well as some block ciphers that give some insight in the Rindael design strategy. In this chapter, some cryptographic algorithms with the design principles based on Rijndael block cipher are analysed.

**Section 10: Analysis of other cryptographic algorithms**
====================================================================

There are some block ciphers that are relevant either because its wide use or because of its importance in the development of cryptanalysis techniques. In this chapter, some cryptographic algorithms from other block ciphers are analysed.

**Section 11: Other applications**
==================================

In this chapter, a number of examples that illustrate some other aspects of the functionality and programming interface of VBF are included.

**Section 12: FAQs**
===================

Frequently Asked Questions.

**Section 13: Bibliography**
===========================

This chapter includes all citations referenced along the Reference Manual.
