**Section 1: Introduction**
===========================

The introduction covers basic concepts and terms around Data Science.

**Section 2: Using the library**
================================

Introduce a Data Analytics Method inspired in the Scientific Method. This method is described in Business Process Modeling Notation(BPMN) as a process consisting in six activities: Definition, Planning, Execution, Data Analysis, Communicate Results and Operationalize.

**Section 3: Initializations and representations**
==================================================

In the Definition activity the addressed research problem is stated alongside with the formulation of the research questions concerning expected results, the objectives of the analysis, as well as the context in which the experiments will be carried out. In this activity, a literature review on problem's subject, including relevant history, such as whether someboby has attempted similar projects in the past, from which we can learn. Initial set of hypotheses are formulated that will be tested against an opposite assumption called the null hypothesis.

**Section 4: Cryptographic Criteria**
=====================================

In the Planning activity, the data scientist operationalizes the hypotheses to be both testable and falsifiable. The resources needed to support the project are assessed, in terms of people, technology, time and data. An analytic sandbox is prepared in which we can work for the duration of the project. ELT and ETL is performed in order to get data into the sandbox, and we begin transforming the data so we can work with it and analyze it. We familiarize ourselves with the data thoroughly and take steps to condition the data.

**Section 5: Operations and constructions over Vector Boolean Functions**
=========================================================================

In the Execution activity, the data scientist determines the methods, techniques and workflow we intend to follow for the model scoring. Explore the datato learn about the relationships between variables, and subsequently select key variables and the models we are likely to use.
