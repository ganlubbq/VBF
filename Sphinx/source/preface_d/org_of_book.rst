Organization of this Book
*************************

**Section 1: Introduction**
===========================

The introduction provides a brief description of the functions available in the VBF library and gives a general overview of the VBF's programming interface and conventions. It also illustrates how to obtain and install the library, and introduces some mathematical preliminaries and notations.  

**Section 2: Using the library**
================================

This chapter describes how to compile programs that use VBF and how to evaluate new algorithms.

**Section 3: Initializations and representations**
==================================================

In this chapter we are going to describe the methods that can be used to represent a VBF class related to a Vector Boolean Function. Some of these representations can be used to initialize a VBF class. 

**Section 4: Cryptographic Criteria**
=====================================

This chapter defines some properties relevant for cryptographic applications and explains how to use the package to compute them. Those properties are criteria or those which provide useful information in cryptanalysis.

**Section 5: Operations and constructions over Vector Boolean Functions**
=========================================================================

In this chapter, the operations over Vector Boolean Functions supported by the VBF library are described.

**Section 6: Analysis of Cryptanalytic Algorithms**
===================================================

In this chapter, a number of examples that illustrate some aspects of the functionality and programming interface of VBF are included.

**Section 7: FAQ**
==================

Frequently Asked Questions.

**Section 8: Bibliography**
===========================

This chapter includes all citations referenced along the Reference Manual.
