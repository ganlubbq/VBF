Overview
========

This section is designed to provide a high level description of terms and
concepts that get brought up in this book. Understanding those new terms 
and concepts will help those working on Data Science communicate with one 
another about the models used to solve analytic problems. Associated new 
acronyms are also provided.

This is not meant to be an exhaustive list nor a completely detailed dictionary
of all of the terms and concepts, only the key ones that may not be a part of
the common vernacular or which would be relevant to the data science
exercises that were covered in the scenarios discussed.


C
+

**Cluster**: Set of devices that work together as a single system to provide an
identical or similar set of functions.


G
+

**GUI**: Graphical User Interface.


H
+

**HTML**: HyperText Markup Language, a markup language that focuses on the
formatting of web pages.

**Hypervisor**: Software that abstracts the hardware on a host machine and
allows the host machine to run multiple virtual machines.


J
+

**JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation, a data encapsulation format that uses
human readable text to encapsulate data objects in attribute and value pairs.


M
+

**Model**: A model is a concept which represents entities and the
relationships that exist between them.


R
+

**REpresentational State Transfer (REST)**: a stateless protocol usually run
over HTTP that allows a client to access a service.  The location that the
client access usually defines the data the client is trying to access from the
service.  Data is usually accessed and returned in either XML or JSON format.

**RESTful**: An API that uses REST, or Representational State Transfer.
 

V
+

**Virtualization**: application of technology used to abstract hardware
resources into virtual representations and allowing software configurability.

 
X
+

**XML**: eXtensible Markup Language, a markup language that focuses on encoding
data for documents rather than the formatting of the data for those documents.
